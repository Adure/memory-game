# memory-game
Memory game is a card matching web app, and second project in my Udacity Nanodegree

## Gameplay
Match all the programming language cards to win!

Your score is what determines your star count. You start with 20 points and for every incorrect turn, meaning two cards have been flipped and dont match, you will lose 1 point. However, you will gain 1 point for every correct turn.

## Dependencies
